## Eater Polymorphism Example


</div>

### Description

Probably useful if you want to learn about polymorphism, objects and collections. This is an example of polymorphism running out of control. 1000 generic Beast-class objects are created, each assigned to be either a Dog, Cat, or Mouse. Then, using calls to the Beast class, they try to eat each other, until only one (the biggest) remains. Try messing around with it ... a larger animal can only eat a smaller one, except in the case of mice who can eat an animal of the same size - it's only fair, they start so small.
 
### More Info
 
Nowt

None, unless I've inadvertently named one of the beasts after your pet and you're sensitive ... ;-)

Dogs nearly always win, by the way.
